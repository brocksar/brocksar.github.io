My name is Sarah. I am currently a Computer Science Masters student at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. I am working with Professor Yuriy Brun in the [LASER](http://laser.cs.umass.edu/ "LASER") lab on a project concerning fairness in facial recognition. Here is my [resume](../files/resume_fall_2019.pdf).

In the past, I have worked with Professor Phil Thomas from the Autonomous Learning Lab ([ALL](http://www-anw.cs.umass.edu/)) for my undergrad honors thesis, as well as our 2019 NeurIPS paper on fair contextual bandits.

If you'd like to learn more about the fairness work going on at UMass, head on over to [aisafety.cs.umass.edu](https://aisafety.cs.umass.edu/about.html).

In December 2019, I had the change to attend NeurIPS in Vancouver, Canada! Check it out [here!](https://women.acm.org/scholars/acm-w-scholars/sarah-brockman/)

On the non-academic side of things, I enjoy hiking (currently working towards hiking all 46 high peaks in the Adirondacks), reading, playing video games, and recently baking.
