My name is Sarah. I am currently a Computer Science Masters student at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. During my time at UMass, I have worked in the Laboratory for Advanced Software Engineering Research ([LASER](http://laser.cs.umass.edu/)) with Prof. Yuriy Brun and the Autonomous Learning Lab ([ALL](http://www-anw.cs.umass.edu/)) with Prof. Phil Thomas. Most of this work has concerned fairness in machine learning, an example of which can be found in our ([2019 NeurIPS paper](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/9630-offline-contextual-bandits-with-high-probability-fairness-guarantees)) on fairness with contextual bandits.

If you'd like to learn more about the fairness work going on at UMass, head on over to [aisafety.cs.umass.edu](https://aisafety.cs.umass.edu/about.html).

Here is my [resume](../files/resume_fall_2019.pdf).

In December 2019, I had the chance to attend NeurIPS in Vancouver, Canada. Check it out [here!](https://women.acm.org/scholars/acm-w-scholars/sarah-brockman/)

On the non-academic side of things, I enjoy hiking (currently working towards hiking all 46 high peaks in the Adirondacks), reading, playing video games, baking, and travelling.
