Hello! My name is Sarah and I am currently a Computer Science Masters student at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. I am currently working with Professor Yuriy Brun in the [LASER](http://laser.cs.umass.edu/ "LASER") lab on a project concerning fairness in facial recognition.

In the past, I have worked with Professor Phil Thomas from the Autonomous Learning Lab ([ALL](http://www-anw.cs.umass.edu/)) for my undergrad honors thesis, as well as our 2019 NeurIPS paper on fair contextual bandits.

If you'd like to learn more about the fairness work going on at UMass, head on over to [aisafety.cs.umass.edu](https://aisafety.cs.umass.edu/about.html).
